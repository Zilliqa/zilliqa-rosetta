## Building `Zilliqa-rosetta standalone image`
### Building the standalone image with current rosetta release
```shell script
sh ./rosetta_standalone/build_standalone.sh
```

### Building the docker image with a specific rosetta tag
```shell script
docker build \
--build-arg ROSETTA_COMMIT_OR_TAG=<ROSETTA_TAG> \
-f rosetta_standalone/Dockerfile_standalone
-t rosetta_standalone:1.0 .
```

|Variable|Description|
|---|---|
|ROSETTA_COMMIT_OR_TAG|Override this to download a specific rosetta commit or version tag|

## Running `Zilliqa-rosetta standalone`

### Configuring `Zilliqa-rosetta`
`Zilliqa-rosetta` configurations yaml allow you to configure which Zilliqa's network and endpoint to connect to. 

```yaml
* rosetta:
  * host: rosetta restful api host
  * port: resetta restful api port
  * version: rosetta sdk version
  * middleware_version: middleware version
* networks:
  * <network_name>:
    * api: api endpoint of mainnet
    * chain_id: chain id of mainnet
    * node_version: zilliqa node verion
  * <network_name>:
    * api: api endpoint of mainnet
    * chain_id: chain id of mainnet
    * node_version: zilliqa node verion
```

Default configuration files for Zilliqa testnet and mainnet combined has been included in Rosetta root directory.
| Network | Config file |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Testnet, Mainnet | `config.local.yaml` |

If you choose to connect `Zilliqa-rosetta` to any existing Zilliqa public endpoints, you can follow the configuration below. <br />A sample of this configuration can be found in `config.local.yaml`.

```yaml
rosetta:
 host: "0.0.0.0"
 port: 8080
 version: "1.4.9"
 middleware_version: "0.0.1"

networks:
 mainnet:
    api: "https://api.zilliqa.com"
    chain_id: 1
    node_version: "v7.1.0"
 testnet:
    api: "https://dev-api.zilliqa.com"
    chain_id: 333
    node_version: "v7.1.0"
```


### Running `Zilliqa-rosetta standalone`
```shell script
sh ./rosetta_standalone/run_standalone.sh
```

### Restarting `Zilliqa-rosetta`

```
docker stop <container name>
docker start <container name>
```

## Restful APIs

### Rosetta restful APIs
Suppored APIs and documentation can be found over at [API.md](API.md).

### Unsupported APIs

These are the following lists of APIs not supported by Zilliqa blockchain:
```
/account/coins
/events/blocks
/search/transactions
```

## How to test
Install the latest rosetta-cli from https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-cli.

At the time of writing, we are using [rosetta-cli v0.6.7](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-cli/releases/tag/v0.6.7).

To begin testing:
1. cd into zilliqa-rosetta folder
2. `go run main.go`
3. Open another terminal and run one of the following depending on the network:

## Testing Data API

**Zilliqa Mainnet**
```
rosetta-cli check:data --configuration-file ./config/mainnet_config.json
```

**Zilliqa Testnet**
```
rosetta-cli check:data --configuration-file ./config/testnet_config.json
```

Note: The `mainnet_config.json` specifically **disables** historical balance lookup and balance tracking options. This is due to the fact that historical balance lookup is not supported on Zilliqa blockchain. In addition, the blockchain rewards miners directly, which results in a single outflow transaction without prior inflow transactions. This will result in `negative balances` errors being raised incorrectly. Hence, both the historical balance lookup and balance tracking options are disabled.

For **testnet** tests, we begin the test from Block 1600000. Some of our much earlier testnet blocks, e.g. Block 270000++, cannot be fetch. Hence, it is recommended to skip certain sections of the testnet blocks.

### Testing Construction API

```
rosetta-cli check:construction --configuration-file ./config/testnet_config.json
```

#### Testing instructions

First, prefund the address in `prefunded_accounts` section in the `testnet_config.json`.

After executing the above line, rosetta-cli would create an address for testing and expecting a minimum amount:
```
looking for balance {"value":"100000000000000","currency":{"symbol":"ZIL","decimals":12}} on account {"address":"zil1xk5shden2xq4s5dp63v3vq4vyacpux0h3z3jx5","metadata":{"base16":"35A90BB73351815851a1D4591602Ac27701E19f7"}}
```

Fund the stated `zil` address with **at least** the (value + gas fees), e.g. the stated value here is `100000000000000 Qa` = `100 ZIL`, so we would send `120 ZIL` (100 for the minimum amount and 20 for the gas fees). Please adjust the gas fees accordingly if you see a "insufficent balance to broadcast transaction" in the console.

Next, `rosetta-cli` would create a payment transaction from the created address to another created address.

Lastly, the test is completed if you see this:
```
[STATS] Transactions Confirmed: 360 (Created: 370, In Progress: 1, Stale: 6, Failed: 9) Addresses Created: 99
```

The construction API test would continue until the funds of the created accounts are emptied. You may halt the test at any time.
